The featured 160 pieces (or sets) are among the Palace Museum’s finest ruyi sceptres as chosen from the collection of over 2,000 related works. The exhibition is divided into the following five sections: Jade Ruyi Sceptres, Bamboo and Wood Ruyi Sceptres, Metal Ruyi Sceptres, Ninefold Ruyi Sceptres, and Ruyi Sceptres of Various Materials. The displays comprehensively reflect the abundant materials, beautiful designs, refined craftsmanship, and numerous themes of ruyi sceptres of the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties. Walking through the galleries, visitors will find a dazzling array of works while, outside the halls atop the Gate of Divine Prowess, stunning scenery affords viewers with a relaxing atmosphere to calm the body and mind.</p>

                      <p class="desc">The Palace Museum was established on the site of the Ming (1368-1644) and the Qing (1644-1911) imperial palace and thus inherited the rich court collection; since the establishment of the museum, the collection of qin has further grown. Consequently, it can now claim to house the world’s finest collection of qin. The Palace Museum has a qin collection of eighty-eight pieces from the Tang, the Song (960-1279), the Yuan (1272-1368), the Ming, and the Qing dynasties, forming a complete series of fine instruments across time and thus giving a relatively complete picture of the instrument's development. This exhibition displays various kinds of related materials, giving visitors a view of qin culture from all angles.
